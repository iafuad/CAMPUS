"""
Lost & Found — Auto-matching logic
===================================
Kept as a plain module (not a signal handler) so it can be called *after*
M2M tags are committed to the database.  Signals fire inside Model.save(),
before form.save_m2m() has run, which means tag data isn't available yet.

Call sites:
  - views.post_create  → after form.save_m2m() and photo upload
  - views.post_edit    → same

Future: if you add a management command to re-score existing suggestions,
just import and call run_auto_match() in a loop there too.
